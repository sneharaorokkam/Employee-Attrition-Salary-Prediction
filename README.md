# Employee-Attrition-Salary-Prediction

Talent attrition represents a prominent challenge for corporations across the spectrum, given that escalated attrition levels potentially trigger amplified recruitment and onboarding costs, dwindling output, and erosion of institutional wisdom. Moreover, elevated rotation rates could adversely affect the morale of the remaining workforce, engendering a challenging operational atmosphere and possibly instigating further talent drain. Pinpointing and comprehending the elements precipitating employee churn is paramount in architecting effective retention strategies, safeguarding critical human assets, and sustaining workforce stability.

In this initiative, our aim is to delve into the correlation between remuneration and other attributes such as professional role, academic qualifications, major, sector, tenure, and proximity to urban centers, vis-Ã -vis staff attrition levels. Our exploration will ascertain whether and to what extent these determinants, with remuneration as a focal point, exert influence on attrition percentages. Our scrutiny is especially relevant in the backdrop of an intensifying talent market, where the procurement and preservation of elite talent has ascended to a strategic imperative for businesses across verticals.

We plan to unravel the complex interplay between these determinants, including compensation, and their potential bearing on attrition rates, leveraging a robust dataset comprising 1,000,000 entries. Our endeavor is to discern patterns and trajectories that can empower enterprises to decipher the root causes of talent attrition via an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA). This intel can subsequently be harnessed to devise targeted initiatives aimed at boosting employee loyalty and crafting a more resilient and productive human capital pool.

Our empirical data comprises both categorical (jobId, companyId, jobType, degree, major, and industry) and quantitative (yearsExperience, milesFromMetropolis, and salary) indicators. The jobId functions as a distinct identifier for each staff member, while the companyId signifies the employing entity. The jobType indicator offers insights into the staff member's role within the organization, while the degree and major indicators elucidate the staff member's educational pedigree. The industry indicator documents the industry in which the staff member operates, while the tenure and milesFromMetropolis indicators furnish data about the staff member's professional experience and the gap between their residence and the organization's premises, respectively. The compensation indicator encapsulates the staff member's pay scale.

By investigating these indicators, our objective is to garner an all-encompassing comprehension of the nuanced facets of talent attrition, accentuating the role of compensation. Moreover, we plan to shed light on the priorities that organizations should emphasize in their pursuit to curb attrition levels and enhance their workforce's overall satisfaction. The current inquiry aspires to untangle the interdependencies between the aforementioned factors and their potential direct or indirect impact on the attrition phenomenon. The investigation endeavors to probe if there exists a linkage between compensation, educational attainment, tenure, and the propensity of staff members to terminate their current engagement. Additionally, the research will evaluate if certain sectors demonstrate a higher propensity towards talent attrition relative to others.
